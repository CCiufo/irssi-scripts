 *  gistlog
    run /lastlog with given arguments and posts as a new public gist on GitHub

These two go together, need a tad more cleanup:
 *  local-growl
    send growl alerts from Irssi via embedded Growl::Tiny code

 *  growlnotify.pl
    pretend to be Extras/growlnotify from the growl distribution by forking
    (for non blocking) then sshing to a remote host and envoking growlnotify
    there

probably not very useful to others, especially without heavy editing

 *  nagios-ack
    keeps track of most recent Nagios alert so you can ack on irc via /ack
